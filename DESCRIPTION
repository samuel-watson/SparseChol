Description: 'C++' classes for sparse matrix methods including implementation of sparse LDL decomposition of symmetric matrices and solvers described by Timothy A. Davis (2016) 
  <https://fossies.org/linux/SuiteSparse/LDL/Doc/ldl_userguide.pdf>. Provides a set of C++ classes for basic sparse
  matrix specification and linear algebra, and a class to implement sparse LDL decomposition and solvers. See <https://github.com/samuel-watson/SparseChol>
